**序言**

依照科学的规划理念，园区在建设初期引进大量全球知名外资企业。大力发展两大先进制造业，同时推进了四大新兴产业的快速升级。逐渐聚集了一大批龙头链主企业，形成特色产业集群布局。  
截至目前，产业项目用地面积总和5907.5公顷；建筑面积总和44713940.43平方米，产业载体面积1200万平方米，规上工业总产值超6500亿元。  
建筑从传统型制造车间，向绿色低碳创新型研发基地转型。  
Adhering to the scientific planning concept, Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) ushered in a large number of world-renowned foreign-funded enterprises, vigorously developed the two advanced manufacturing industries, and drove the rapid upgrading of the four emerging industries in its early years. Thus, a large number of chain-leader enterprises gradually gathered, forming a characteristic industrial clusters.  
To date, SIP’s industrial projects totally cover a land area of 5,907.5 hectares and a floor area of 44,713,940.43 square meters including industrial carriers of 12 million square meters. And its total industrial output value above statistics threshold exceeds 650 billion yuan.  
The buildings here are transforming from traditional manufacturing plants to green, low-carbon and innovative R\&D bases.

**结语**

工业建筑作为园区的重要组成部分，既是产业发展的重要载体，也见证了园区产业与城市发展的历程。  
同时，园区也积极推动产业结构优化升级，通过科技创新和人才培养，大力发展生物医药，纳米技术，人工智能等新兴产业，提高了产业的核心竞争力。  
展望未来，苏州工业园区将立足产业优势、整合资源要素，因地制宜推广应用智能建造装备，高位推动建筑业、制造业融合发展，产业快速转型升级，打造具有全球影响力的产业科技创新中心、成为新质生产力的重要阵地。

As an important part of SIP, the industrial buildings are not only carriers of its industrial development, but also the witnesses of its industrial and urban development.   
At the same time, SIP also actively promotes the industrial structure optimization and upgrading, vigorously develops emerging industries including biomedicine, nanotechnology, and AI and improves the core competitiveness of industries through sci-tech innovation and talent cultivation.  
Looking forward to the future, SIP will integrate resource elements based on its industrial advantages; expand the application of intelligent construction equipment based on local conditions to boost the integrated development of building and manufacturing sectors at a high level; rapidly transform and upgrade its industries to build industrial sci-tech innovation center with global influence and make itself an important position for developing new quality productivity.
